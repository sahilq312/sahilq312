Welcome to my personal blog! I'm excited to share with you my journey in building LetterLoop, an email marketing tool that has led me down a fascinating path of scalable architecture and cutting-edge technologies.

It all began with a simple need: to send emails efficiently. As I delved deeper into this challenge, I realized the importance of creating a system that could handle large volumes of emails without compromising performance. This realization sparked an intensive research phase, which ultimately led me to explore the world of queuing systems.

After careful consideration, I decided to implement RabbitMQ, a robust message broker that perfectly suited my needs. Paired with Node.js, I was able to create a powerful and flexible queuing system that formed the backbone of LetterLoop's email dispatch mechanism.

But my quest for scalability didn't stop there. To further enhance performance, I incorporated Redis as a caching layer and implemented Redis Cluster to efficiently store and manage the email queue. This addition significantly improved the system's ability to handle high loads and ensure rapid email delivery.

While working on the email sending functionality, I initially used Nodemailer, a popular Node.js module. However, as I continued to push for greater scalability and reliability, I made the decision to transition to Amazon Simple Email Service (AWS SES). This enterprise-grade solution offered the robustness and scalability that LetterLoop required, allowing for seamless email delivery even at high volumes.

To round out the tech stack, I chose Next.js for the frontend, leveraging its powerful features for building modern, responsive user interfaces. For data persistence, I opted for PostgreSQL, a battle-tested relational database that provides the perfect balance of performance and reliability.

Join me as I dive deeper into each of these technologies and share the insights I've gained while building LetterLoop. Whether you're a fellow developer, an email marketing enthusiast, or simply curious about modern web architectures, I hope you'll find value in the experiences and lessons I'll be sharing on this blog.
